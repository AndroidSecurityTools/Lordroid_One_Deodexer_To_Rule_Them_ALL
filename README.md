#### Guide lines & troubleshooting :
1. make sure the is a build.prop file in the selected folder 
2. make sure the is a framwork folder under the selected folder.
3. make sure the rom is odexed ! make a search in system folder with the request ".odex" if no results are there then your rom is deodexed and you don't need to run this tool on it.
4. make sure `JRE 7` or higher is the default JRE see the output of java -version you should see `1.8.x` or `1.7.x` if `1.6.x` or lower the tool will not work for roms > sdk 20 lollipop and above !
5. make sur the system folder you chose is writable (means you have the right to write inside it) otherwise the tool will not work.
6. if your rom is sdk > 20 make sure you have a `boot.oat` file under `framework/**` other wise the tool will not work.
7. if you followed all those instructions and you are still having trouble send me a link to your rom or list me the all files under `/system/framework` ,`/system/app` and `/system/priv-app`.
